								<h2 >Project Description</h2>
								<br>
								<p align="left"> In the fall of 2019, PeakActivity decided to move forward with a new product serving the determined need to create a mobile platform for health and fitness clubs. Having worked with a fitness company in the past creating an app, the company wanted to take the platform to others. It would offer gyms an app that allows for class sign-ups, member management, payment, and merchandise purchasing, The app will come with a desktop portal aimed at giving gyms data about their members and tools to manage their business such as employee management and billing tools. As a writer with the company, they tasked me with putting together business research documents and a marketing pitch for the new product. </p>

								<h2 >Audience</h2>

								<p align="left"> The audience of this work had two parts. The business documents were to be read by the upper management of the company and the developers. The documents I came up with would become the first features list by which the developers would assemble the product. The marketing documents and website content that I created would have a very narrow audience of gym owners and managers looking for an all in one studio management tool. To better understand this audience, I spoke to the project lead for the fitness company that PeakActivity already worked with. Along with my partner, we gathered notes from the meeting and determined that the most important thing to focus on when marketing to this audience is the inclusion of data. Fitness studio management wants to know the data that will help them keep their members. This was something that we focused on when writing marketing materials moving forward.

								<h2 >Constraints and Goals</h2>

								<p align="left"> The rhetorical goals that I had for this project were to create documents that would become a development roadmap for the company while creating this platform. By completing a competitive analysis I could determine the need for the product in the health and fitness world and also the features that we would need to provide to remain competitive. My goal was to create content that reflected the research that I had done to create an end product that would be marketable.  </p>

								<h2>Process</h2>

								<h3>Step One: Audit and Analysis</h3>


								<p align="left">
								In step one, I conducted my research to find out the current state of content in and around health and fitness club apps. I created an extensive competitive analysis to see what strategies other companies were using and what their strengths and weaknesses were. I also spoke to a health and fitness app used to determine what his goals were in getting an app and how it would best help him. 
								</p>
								<h3>Step Two: Strategy</h3>


								<p align="left">
								In step two I analyzed my research to decide how it could help us reach our audience. I created a business canvas comprising target audience analysis and messaging that we could use to best reach them. This included a journey map of the problems they face and the solutions that we could provide to solve those problems. I included our unique market add for each problem and the strategies we can use to reach users at that point. The document also listed existing alternatives from the competitive analysis.  I also created a document containing all. I created short blubs that called out the best features that the product will offer and how it can help the end-user. 
								</p>
								<h3>Step 3: Plan </h3>


								<p align="left">
								In step three I decided on the content that would work best, the outlets to used to reach prospective users. I added this information to the business canvas. 
								</p>
								<h3>Step 4: Create </h3>


								<p align="left">
								In step four I began creating content for the Pialta. I began with short social media blurbs that would call out the problems I had listed and tell the user how we would solve them. From that messaging, I began work on the website content. I used the pain points to determine that health studios want to market themselves to potential customers, motivate their current customers, and maintain their business. These three goals became the main headers on the website and also headings on our one-page flyer.  My coworker created a web design and branding materials for the product.  
								</p>
								<h3>Step 5: Maintain </h3>


								<p align="left">
								In step 5, I made a plan to continue to develop content as the product is being built. The current list of goals is to create a sales pitch, and a user guides along with developer documentation. As we create the content, I hope to test our messaging with users and adapt as we continue to grow the product. Periodically, I add more research to my competitive analysis to keep up with the growing market. I will take this information into account as I continue to build content.

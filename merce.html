								<h2 id="rhet" class="">Rhetorical Situation</h2>
								<p>merce is a new product being built by the technology company PeakActivty as an easy to use corporate ecommerce website builder, an all in one solution to creating a large company website that requires eCommerce sections to be the main focus. To understand the rhetorical situation of this product, it is important to understand the history of PeakActivity. PeakActivity is a small firm of about 30 employees that has become a leader in eCommerce website building in South Florida in the last 10 years. </p>

								PeakActivity has particularly taken off for custom-built web platforms for companies who use eCommerce technology in their stores for users and associates to complete purchases and find and test products in the store and online. Building a platform like this used to require separately developing product databases, mobile apps, desktop apps, point of sale apps, loyalty apps, multiple websites, and interfaces that didn’t necessarily communicate well with each other when it comes to updating and storing information. merce is trying to streamline that process. </p>

								After completing successfully these types of builds, the company decided to create a real solution to storing, updating, and creating all of the interfaces and applications required for these types of large scale projects, solving many of the issues that they have found over the years in the process, such as having integrations with apps like Shopify and AWS and creating cloud-based databases that will keep sites running even if servers are down.  In late 2019, the merce product launched the first beta platform. The first site contained over 4,000 easily referenceable products. </p>

								In the midst of this history, I had been working for PeakActivity as a copywriter in the summer of 2018, and 2019. I was commissioned to create all of the marketing material for the product, and more notably, I was given the task of writing, editing, and testing a user guide for the unfinished product. </p>

								<h2 id="" >Goals and Contraints</h2>
								<p align="left">My goal was to create a comprehensive user guide specifically for the website-build and product database portion of the platform (merceStudio) for an audience of users who I determined to be non-technical marketing employees who would be tasked with curating the website for their company. They will have to add and update content and products using the interface. With the launch of one client site just months away at the start of the project, I worked to create the user guide at the pace that the product was being built, with new parts and features being built each week and immediately added the user guide so that nothing was left behind. </p> 

								<p align="left">I was constrained by the pace of the developers, and also my status as a remote worker. My own exploration of the product gave me most of my information, with support from developers and others. While I had plenty of time to complete the document, getting the necessary information was the hardest task. </p> 
								
								<h2>Processes and Literature Review </h2>


								<p align="left">
								Following the guidance of my reading, I will guide my writing with the 5 phase process model developed by JoAnn Hakos in the book <em>Managing Your Documentation Products. </em>The steps include the following: 
								</p>
								<ol>

								<li align="left">
								Information Planning 

								<li align="left">Content Specification 

								<li align="left">Implementation 

								<li align="left">Production 

								<li align="left">Evaluation
								<p align="left">
								Below is a proposed plan of how I will adapt these steps toward my project of creating a merceStudio user guide. 
								</p>
							</li></ol>
																
								<h2>Phase 1: Information Planning </h2>


								<p align="left">
								Phase 1 in Hackos’ (1994, 29–33) development model requires an initial investigation on the requirements of the documentation project and the estimation of resources required in the project. The required discussions to gather this information have already been completed by the client. They decided on information planning is listed below. 
								</p>
								<h3>Tools and Media </h3>


								<p align="left">
								The authoring of the user guide will take place in GoogleDocs to allow for easy collaboration. Google Docs is the standard for documentation by PeakActivity and will allow for gifs. 
								</p>
								<p>
								The gifs which will be used as visuals in the user guide will be created with Gyazo, a screen capture tool that allows the free export of .gif files. To gather the gifs, I found what seemed to be the hardest task to find and record the placement of the mouse and the process of completion. These were posted as .gif files onto the merce shared Google Drive. There they can be accessed and referenced when the time comes to post them onto the website. 
								</p>
								<p align="left">
								I also created a series of videos created in Adobe Premiere Pro using screen capture videos and my own voice overs. There are currently 5 videos which can be placed on the website. 
								</p>
								<h3>Audience Description </h3>


								<p align="left">
								The following portion of phase one includes audience analysis. According to Hakos, this includes researching information on the users of the documentation and their goals and tasks in using the documentation. 
								</p>
								<p align="left">
								There are two ways I chose to complete this. First, I analyzed the target audience for the product since the product boasts of easy website building for non-technical users. Second, I spoke with the product’s first-ever user to listen to her knowledge level and concerns about using the platform to better understand how to write for more people like her.  
								</p>
								<p align="left">
								merce markets themselves to companies with legacy platforms that are notoriously difficult to replace, requiring years of time and effort and a team of developers. By using merce, companies can assign non-technical users to the job of maintaining and creating web updates including product pages, marketing pages, and blog pages. merce operates like a CMS but for large enterprises that need e-commerce capabilities for non-technical users. 
								</p>
								<p align="left">
								Because of the way that merce is marketing toward a user-friendly non-technical experience, the target audience of the user guide is non-technical marketing professionals who are working in a large enterprise environment. Their attitudes about using this product may be skeptical, as it may have been a higher business decision that has put them into the role of web curator. The materials that I create will be used in training for such professionals. Taking all of this into consideration, the user guide must be easy to read, and friendly, with a slight marketing tone, used to convince the reader that the product is easy to use. I will assume that no technical knowledge is necessary to read and understand the user guide and each piece will be broken down accordingly. 
								</p>
								<p align="left">
								To complete my audience research, I took the opportunity to speak with a woman who would be a merce user for the first company to launch using the merce platform. At the time, merce only had one user, and it was going to be her. Her role in the company was as an Operations Supervisor, and she was in charge of the transfer of information from the current company site to merceStudio. In speaking with her, I was able to identify that she was non-technical in the sense that she had never built a website, but she had a basic understanding of how websites work in their structure and navigation in her work as a supervisor. In fact, she was concerned with the UX involved in creating navigation on the site since her company had franchises that would need separate navigations. I was able to train her in the basic functions of merce, and her questions showed that her knowledge was more than I had expected a user to have. She was worried about franchises who had their own websites using the platform having less knowledge than her about websites which gave me an insight into two types of users. Her franchise user fits well into my own understanding of the target audience user. After speaking with her I created a persona of both types of users below to help me guide my authoring. 
								</p>

								<h2>Timeline and Deliverables </h2>


								<p align="left">
								In early July, the goal was set to launch the first company merce platform on November 1, 2019. This gave me plenty of time to create a user guide with all current launch features. Since the launch of the site meant that all parts of the site would be completed, the merceStudio user guide needed to be completed by October 1 to allow time for training and site migration. My deliverables to the company for this project included: 
								</p>
								<ul>

								<li>
								Project Plan for Client including Content Specification Plan

								<li>A literature review on the viability of gif animations as instructional tools 

								<li>merceStudio User Guide Authored in Google Docs

								<li>merceStudio User Guide as a MarkDown File (For an easy transition to webpage)

								<li>Report on the usability of the user guide 

								<li>Five 30-second videos demonstrating completion of common tasks

								<li>Project wrap-up report for the company 
								</ul>
								<p>
								All deliverables were to be completed by Dec. 1, 2019. 
								</p>

								<h2>Phase 2: Content Specification </h2>
							</li></ul>

								<p align="left">
								Phase 2 in Hackos’ (33–34) development model involves adding details to the plans that have been compiled and approved for implementation in the previous phase. There were two deliverables in Phase 2: a content specification plan and a revised project plan. I compiled these into a single document entitled ““User Guide Plan and Content Specification.”” for submission to the client. At this stage, I also completed a literature review on the viability of gif animations as instructional tools. I took that information to decide to use gifs as the primary visual component in the user guide. 
								</p>
								<h2>Phase 3: Implementation </h2>


								<p align="left">
								Phase 3 in Hackos’ (34–36) development model contains the design and the development of the documentation. This phase features several deliverables as multiple versions of the documentation. For merce, as agreed upon, this consisted of a user guide of existing documentation including gifs of current interface visuals. 
								</p>
								<p align="left">
								Andrew Etter claims that writing is only 10% of the process of creating documentation. (Etter Ch. 4). I felt that it came together very quickly once I began writing. I closely followed Christopher Gales advice in “The Product is Docs”: 
								</p>
								<p align="left">

								    Write from primary sources. When writing procedures, perform a step and then write it immediately. Report it as it happens. There is a testing aspect to this, too: try making likely mistakes and seeing what happens. If the software does not handle errors gracefully, file defects. (106) 
								</p>
								<p align="left">
								To write the user guide, I slowly worked directly through the merceStudio system. When I first began, there were only a few tasks that could be completed: Adding a webpage, editing a webpage, adding products to the page, and adjusting themes. I began with just those tasks, separating them by the tab in which they were contained in the system. Thankfully, the user experience in these tasks was good, and there were very few steps. But, as features and settings began to be added to the merceStudio, the functionality became more difficult to describe. Building upon what I started with, I kept the sections separated into the tabs in which they are found in merceStudio. Each week, the development team would present more new features, and I would document accordingly. 
								</p>
								<p align="left">
								Near the end of November 2019, I had completed writing for what would become version 1 of merceStudio. I was ready to present this user guide to the first client. While new features were constantly being added, the user guide remained up to date with the current features. I was also able to deliver 5 training videos to go with the user guide and to accompany the final user guide webpage. 
								</p>
								<p align="left">
								It was decided that the first implementation would take place by way of a training presentation presented to the Operations Supervisor, who would oversee the implementation of merce for the first client. I prepared for this meeting by taking the user guide and dividing it into sections. I created a presentation where I would run through each of the simple tasks, for each section. In the background of my slides, I had planned to go through all of the steps in merce for the presentation while sharing my screen. Unfortunately, on the day of the presentation, I was informed that merceStudio would be down. Instead, I screen captured a long-form demo video which I was able to play on top of my slides to demonstrate the actions.    
								</p>
								<h2>Phase 4: Production </h2>


								<p align="left">
								Phase 4 in Hackos’ (36–37) development model includes the activities required to deliver the final version of the documentation to the user of the product. These activities preparing and localizing the final versions of the report into their forms. In my proposal I had assumed the final version of this document would be the Google Doc file and the Markdown file. I found a very simple Google Docs extension automatically translated the doc to .md. I found quickly that I was not going to be satisfied with the visual of the user guide if either form. I wanted to generate a help portal like those I worked with on my Cengage project. 
								</p>
								<p align="left">
								So as a part of this project, I decided I would take the opportunity to learn an authoring tool that had been introduced in my reading by Andrew Etter. A large part of the reading was dedicated to the idea that Sphinx a static site generator is the future of technical writing. Once I had my user guide completed to my satisfaction in Google Docs, I set out to learn how to translate it into a Sphinx generated static site. 
								</p>
								<p align="left">
								Several resources guided me as I learning. In the beginning, just the install of the Sphinx software was a challenge. Several Youtube videos guided me, most notably <a href="https://youtu.be/oJsUvBQyHBs">this one</a>. Sphinx has a quick-start setting that put together a site for me in about a minute. While the file structure was confusing, I was able to find out through further research which files had to be edited to make the site. For example, all of the settings were included in the conf.py file, which was written in Python. I used several forums and articles, most notably <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-riddle-of-sphinx-how-to-document-your-code-easily-bf09a9a1804c/">this one</a>, to adjust the settings. To create the site, I found that I had to open the “docs” file in the Terminal of my Mac, and tell the command prompt to “make html”. Once I did that, my site html was automatically written into the “build” folder. 
								</p>
								<p align="left">
								My first step was to structure the table of contents in the Sphinx index file that it wrote for me. I wanted to structure the navigation so that it would fall into chunks that didn’t go below the fold of the page, and gave enough headings that users could click through to find what they were looking for. At this point, the card sort that I did for Cengage on their help portal navigation guided what I wanted the navigation to look like. I was aware that I didn’t want to give users more than 7 options. I decided to break it up into the following categories: 
								</p>
								<ol>

								<li>Introduction 

								<li>Managing Blogs 

								<li>Managing Careers 

								<li>Managing Products 

								<li>Themes and Settings 
								</li>
								</ol>
								</li>
								</ul>
								<p align="left">
								I broke up my .rst files into these categories, and I placed these into the index files with the understanding that Sphinx would read the headings inside the files and make them into menu options. 
								</p>
								<p align="left">
								While Sphinx boasts of it's easy use of .md files, I was unable to get the program to read my .md files that I had created with Google Docs. Instead, I had to translate them into reStructuredtext (.rst), another language I learned in this process. I found a converter that automatically created the .rst files from my MarkDown files. The converter also ran editing and spellcheck, which was very helpful at this stage. For Sphinx to read the files, I placed them into the “source” folder it had created for me and ran the “make html”. 
								</p>
								<p align="left">
								After a few weeks of tweaking and editing, I finished the merce User Guide Help Portal. I was thrilled with the results.
